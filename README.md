### Documentation
In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your `lib` directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.

There are two functions exported in the arithmetic module
1. sum - a function that takes in two arity that are numbers and adds them together or else returns null if the arity are NaN

2. sub - a function that again takes in two arity and subtracts the second from the first. Also returns null if either argument is NaN.
